    <title>BLOG EDITOR - RICHCODE DEV</title>
  </head>
  <body style="padding:20px;">
    <a href='index.html'>Back to Editor </a>
  <h1>How to use: Blog Editor</h1>
    <h2>1. Write the page</h2>
    <p>Fill out the Title, Date, and Author input boxes. Then, start writing the content of the article in the rich text editor. You can bold, italisize, underline, change text color, etc... You can also add links and code. </p>
    <h2>2. Preview</h2>
    <p>
      Click the preview button on the right top corner to preview your article. Check it through, and make changes accordingly. This is how your article will look on the website. 
    </p>
    <h2>3. Save and Load</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to save a "draft", or write a bit now, then finish it tomorrow or something, you can save the existing draft. When you are done writing for now and want to save your draft, click on the Save to Local button on the bottom, and a small file will be saved on your computer with the draft on it. This is acomplished through the browser Local Storage. Please note that if you save this way, clearing cookies, cache, and/or browsing history will delete whatever you have saved. When you are ready to resume writing, click on the Load from Local button on the bottom, and the saved contents will appear. If you often clear cookies/cache/browsing history, and/or don't trust localstorage, and/or just want to save it as a draft, click the Save as TXT button on the bottom of the screen. Copy the text that appears and save it. When you are ready to resume editing, click Load from TXT button on the bottom, and input the text you copied when saving the draft. Then, click Load into Document and the draft will appear in the editor. 
    </p>
    <h2>4. Publishing</h2>
    <p>
      When you are ready to publish your article, click the Publish button on the bottom. Then, scroll down to see the files and instructions generated. <b>Take note of the file name generated, and the contents of the two files generated, and send all three pieces of text to Richard or Lucas or send them in the group chat, and one of us can add it to the github. </b></p>
    <h2>5. Viewing the published article</h2>
    <p>
      Our official website is not updated often, so to see your article once it is in the github, go to <a href="https://richcode.netlify.app">richcode.netlify.app</a> for a real-time view. If the navbar is not severly broken and the home page works, and the blog is showing up in the navbar (trust me that will be the case most of the time), you can try to navigate to the blog to see the post. Otherwise, go directly to <a href="https://richcode.netlify.app/blog/">richcode.netlify.app/blog/</a> and see if that works, otherwise just go to richcode.netlify.app/blog/articles/ followed by the file name (should be something like 10-26-2023-titleofarticle.html) and that should be hopefully your article. Anyways most of the time the live version is a mess.
